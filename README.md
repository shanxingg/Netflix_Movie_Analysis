# dataviz_project

This project is intended to get us understand and answer the following questions:
-	Does higher rating movie also have a higher adjusted gross revenue?
-	Shall we make a short movie or a long movie?
-	If a movie does well in US, does it also usually do well overseas? 
-	What is the strategy for Netflixâ€™s next investment in a movie?
